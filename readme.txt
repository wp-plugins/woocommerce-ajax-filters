= Shortcode: =
* In editor `[br_filters attribute=price type=slider title="Price Filter"]`
* In PHP `do_shortcode('[br_filters attribute=price type=slider title="Price Filter"]');`

= Shortcode Options: =
* `widget_type` - filter or update_button
* `attribute`(required) - product attribute, eg price or length. Don't forget that woocommerce adding pa_ suffix for created attributes.
 So if you create new attribute `jump` its name is `pa_jump`
* `type`(required) - checkbox, radio, slider or select
* `operator` - OR or AND
* `title` - whatever you want to see as title. Can be empty
* `product_cat` - parent category id
* `cat_propagation` - should we propagate this filter to child categories? set 1 to turn this on
* `height` - max filter box height. When height is met scroll will be added
* `scroll_theme` - pretty clear name, scroll theme. Will be used if height is set and real height of box is more


= Advanced Settings (Widget area): =

* CSS Class - if you want to style filters in different manner you can add class here and use it in css
* Product Category - if you want to pin your filter to category of the product this is good place to do it.
 Eg. You selling Phones and Cases for them. If user choose Category "Phones" filter "Have Wi-Fi" will appear
 but if user will choose "Cases" it will not be there as Admin set that "Have Wi-Fi" filter will be visible only on
 "Phones" category.
* Filter Box Height - if your filter have too much options it is nice to limit height of the filter to not prolong
 the page too much. Scroll will appear.
* Scroll theme - if "Filter Box Height" is set and box length is more than "Filter Box Height" scroll appear and
 how it looks depends on the theme you choose.


= Advanced Settings (Plugin Settings): =
* Plugin settings can be found in admin area, WooCommerce -> Product Filters
* "No Products" message - Text that will be shown if no products found
* "No Products" class - Add class and use it to style "No Products" box
* Products selector - Selector for tag that is holding products
* Sorting control - Take control over WooCommerce's sorting selectbox
* SEO friendly urls - url will be changed when filter is selected/changed
* Turn all filters off - If you want to hide filters without losing current configuration just turn them off



== Installation ==

= Step 1: =
* First you need to add attributes to the products ( WooCommerce plugin should be installed and activated already )
* Go to Admin area -> Products -> Attributes and add attributes your products will have, add them all
* Click attribute's name where type is select and add values to it. Predefine product options
* Go to your products and add attributes to each of them

= Step 2: =
* Install and activate plugin
* Go to Admin area -> Appearance -> Widgets
* In Available Widgets ( left side of the screen ) find AJAX Product Filters
* Drag it to Sidebar you choose for it
* Enter title, choose attribute that will be used for filtering products, choose filter type,
 choose operator( whether product should have all selected values (AND) or one of them (OR) ),
* Click save and go to your shop to check how it work.
* That's it =)
